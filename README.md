"Time Keeper"

This firmware goes along with my [open-source OLED Watch project](http://jared.geek.nz/2014/jul/oshw-oled-watch).
It is written for the PIC24FJ256DA206 and PIC24FJ256GB206, using the XC16 free (or pro) compiler, and MPLAB-X for the IDE.

## Features ##

- Custom RTOS
- Custom graphics library
- Application framework
- Device drivers for connected sensors
- USB HID communications (driver free!)
- It can tell the time!

## Screenshots ##

These were pulled directly from the watch while it was operating!
